    "# **4: Going Deeper - Architecting ResNet-18 from Scratch**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement the ResNet-18 architecture from scratch using PyTorch. ResNet-18 is a popular convolutional neural network architecture that introduced the concept of residual connections, allowing for deeper networks without suffering from vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "As networks get deeper, they can learn more complex features, but they also become harder to train due to issues like vanishing gradients. ResNet addresses this problem by introducing skip connections that allow gradients to flow directly through the network, enabling the training of much deeper architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vanishing Gradients**: As we add more layers to a neural network, the gradients used for updating the weights can become very small, making it difficult for the network to learn. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Solution: Residual Connections**\n",
    "\n",
    "Resnet (residual Network) solves this problem with a brillantly simple idea: instead of learning a direct mapping from input to output, it learns a residual mapping. This is achieved by adding `skip connections` or `shortcut connections` that bypass one or more layers. The output of these layers is added to the input, allowing the network to learn the difference (residual) between the input and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like an express lane on a highway. If the main road (the deeper layers) is congested, the traffic (gradients) can take the express lane (skip connection) to reach the destination (output) faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `If a layer is useful:` The network can learn to use it by adjusting the weights to produce a useful output.\n",
    "- `If a layer is not useful:` The network can learn to ignore it by adjusting the weights to produce an output close to zero, effectively bypassing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this design is that it allows the network to learn both simple and complex features without being hindered by the depth of the network. This is why ResNet architectures can be much deeper than traditional CNNs while still being trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "`The key insight:` By adding the original input `x` directly to the output of a convolutional stack (a `\"residual block\"`), the network can easily learn to preserve the input if the convolutional layers are not useful, or learn to modify it if they are useful. This flexibility is what allows ResNet to train very deep networks effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a residual block can be expressed as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "y = F(x) + x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `F(x)` is the output of the convolutional layers in the block, and `x` is the original input. The network learns to optimize `F(x)` such that the overall output `y` is as close as possible to the desired output, while still allowing for the possibility of preserving the input if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also put it this way: instead of learning `H(x)`, the network learns `F(x) = H(x) - x`, which is the residual. Then the output can be rewritten as `y = F(x) + x`, which is the original input plus the residual. This allows the network to learn the identity function (if needed) by simply setting `F(x)` to zero, making it easier to train deeper networks."

    "### **A more challenging Dataset: CIFAR-10**\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the power of ResNet-18, we will use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. This dataset is more complex than MNIST and will allow us to see the benefits of using a deeper architecture like ResNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CIFAR-10 Characteristics:**\n",
    "- `60,000` images (50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing)\n",
    "- 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck\n",
    "- Each image is `32x32` pixels with 3 color channels (RGB)\n",
    "- `50,000` training images and `10,000` test images\n",
    "- The dataset is more complex than `MNIST`, making it a good test case for deeper architectures like ResNet-18\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Shape: (Batch Size, Channels, Height, Width)**\n",
    "- For CIFAR-10, the input shape will be `(Batch Size, 3, 32, 32)` since the images are in color (3 channels) and have a height and width of 32 pixels each.\n",
    "- The batch size can be set to any value (e.g., 64, 128) depending on the available computational resources and the desired training speed.\n",
    "- For example, if we set the batch size to 128, the input shape for a batch of CIFAR-10 images would be `(128, 3, 32, 32)`.\n",
    "- `32x32` is the height and width of the images, and `3` represents the RGB color channels. The batch size can be adjusted based on memory constraints and training requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a setup in difficulty from the previous notebook, where we used the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits. The CIFAR-10 dataset is more complex due to its color images and greater variety of classes, making it a more suitable test case for demonstrating the capabilities of deeper architectures like ResNet-18.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Color channels`: We now have 3 channels (RGB) instead of 1 (grayscale), which adds complexity to the input data.\n",
    "- `More classes`: CIFAR-10 has 10 classes compared to MNIST's 10 classes, but the images are more complex and varied, making classification more challenging.\n",
    "- `Smaller image size`: The images in CIFAR-10 are smaller (32x32) compared to MNIST (28x28), which can make it more difficult for the network to learn meaningful features, especially in the early layers.\n",
    "- `More complex features`: The images in CIFAR-10 contain more complex features and variations (e.g., different backgrounds, lighting conditions, and object orientations) compared to the relatively simple and uniform images in MNIST. This requires a more powerful architecture like ResNet-18 to effectively learn and classify the images."

When we want to reduce the spatial dimensions (e.g., from 32x32 to 16x16), we can set the stride to `2`. This effectively downsamples the feature maps, allowing the network to learn more abstract features at different scales. This is why ResNet can learn hierarchical features, with early layers learning low-level features and deeper layers learning high-level features."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Architecture Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Stem (Initial Convolutional Layer):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conv1`: A convolutional layer with a `7x7` kernel, `64` output channels, and a stride of `2`. This layer processes the input image and reduces its spatial dimensions.\n",
    "- `bn1`: Batch normalization applied to the output of `conv1` to stabilize and accelerate training.\n",
    "- `relu`: ReLU activation function applied after batch normalization to introduce non-linearity.\n",
    "- `maxpool`: A max pooling layer with a `3x3` kernel and a stride of `2` to further reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Four Main Layers (Each Composed of BasicBlocks):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `layer1`: Contains `2 BasicBlocks` with `64` output channels. This layer processes the feature maps from the stem and learns low-level features. (no downsampling)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `layer2`: Contains `2 BasicBlocks` with `128` output channels. This layer processes the output from `layer1` and learns more complex features. (downsampling with stride=2: 32x32 -> 16x16)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `layer3`: Contains `2 BasicBlocks` with `256` output channels. This layer processes the output from `layer2` and learns even more complex features. (downsampling with stride=2: 16x16 -> 8x8)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `layer4`: Contains `2 BasicBlocks` with `512` output channels. This layer processes the output from `layer3` and learns high-level features. (downsampling with stride=2: 8x8 -> 4x4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Classification Head:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `AdaptiveAvgPool2d`: A global average pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to `1x1`, effectively summarizing the features learned by the convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Linear(512, num_classes)`: A fully connected layer that takes the output from the global average pooling layer (which has `512` channels) and produces an output with a size equal to the number of classes (e.g., `10` for CIFAR-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture allows `ResNet-18` to learn a hierarchy of features, with early layers learning low-level features (e.g., edges, textures) and deeper layers learning high-level features (e.g., object parts, whole objects). The use of `BasicBlocks` with skip connections enables the network to train effectively even with a deeper architecture, making it suitable for complex datasets like CIFAR-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ResNet-18?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet-18 is a popular choice for demonstrating the power of residual connections because it is deep enough to show significant improvements over traditional CNNs, but not so deep that it becomes difficult to train or understand. It strikes a good balance between complexity and performance, making it an ideal architecture for learning about the benefits of residual connections and deeper networks. Additionally, ResNet-18 has been widely used in research and industry, making it a relevant and practical example for learning about modern CNN architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ResNet-18` gets its name from the fact that it has `18 layers` (including convolutional layers and fully connected layers) and is part of the ResNet family of architectures that utilize residual connections to enable the training of deeper networks. It is a widely used architecture in computer vision tasks and serves as a foundational model for understanding the benefits of residual connections in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 initial convolutional layer\n",
    "- 4 layers x 2 blocks x 2 convolutional layers per block = 16 convolutional layers\n",
    "- 1 fully connected layer\n",
    "- Total: 1 + 16 + 1 = 18 layers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The _make_layer Helper Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually defining each layer of `BasicBlocks`, we can use a helper method called `_make_layer` to create layers with a specified number of blocks, output channels, and stride. This method simplifies the process of building the ResNet architecture and allows for more flexibility when defining different ResNet variants (e.g., `ResNet-34`, `ResNet-50`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates the first block with the specified stride and output channels, which may involve downsampling if the stride is greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For subsequent blocks in the same layer, it creates them with a stride of 1 and the same number of output channels, since they do not require downsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method allows us to easily create layers of `BasicBlocks` with varying configurations, making it easier to build different ResNet architectures without having to manually define each block. It also helps to keep the code organized and modular, improving readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using the `_make_layer` method, we can quickly assemble the ResNet architecture by simply specifying the number of blocks, output channels, and stride for each layer, rather than having to write out each block individually. This is especially beneficial when building deeper ResNet variants that require more layers and blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `_make_layer` method also handles the creation of the downsampling layer when necessary, ensuring that the dimensions of the input and output match for the skip connections in the `BasicBlocks`. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the residual connections and allowing the network to learn effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, the `_make_layer` helper method is a key component in the implementation of ResNet architectures, providing a convenient and efficient way to build layers of `BasicBlocks` while ensuring that the necessary downsampling and dimension matching are handled correctly.\n"

    "2. **Progressive Channel Increase**: The number of channels increases as we go deeper into the network `(64->128->256->512)`, enabling the network to learn more complex features at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Residual Connections**: The skip connections in the `BasicBlocks` allow the network to learn residual mappings, which helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and enables the training of deeper networks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Global Average Pooling**: The use of `AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)` reduces the spatial dimensions to `1x1`, effectively summarizing the learned features before the final classification layer, which helps to reduce the number of parameters and prevent overfitting."

    "## **Training the ResNet**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll train `ResNet-18` on `CIFAR-10`. This is significantly more computationally intensive than our previous models—ResNet-18 has `~11 million` parameters compared to the simple CNN's few thousand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Training a ResNet from scratch on `CIFAR-10` will take much longer than training simpler models. You may want to reduce the number of epochs for initial testing, or use GPU acceleration if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the `ResNet-18` model on the `CIFAR-10` dataset, we will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Load the `CIFAR-10` dataset and apply necessary transformations (e.g., normalization, data augmentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Initialization**: Create an instance of the `ResNet-18` model and move it to the appropriate device (CPU, GPU, or MPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss Function and Optimizer**: Define the loss function (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss) and the optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD) for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Loop**: Implement the training loop to iterate over the training data, compute the loss, and update the model weights using backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: After training, evaluate the model on the test set to assess its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the increased complexity of `ResNet-18`, we can expect to see improved performance on the `CIFAR-10` dataset compared to simpler models, especially if we train for enough epochs and use appropriate data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slower training**: ResNet-18 has significantly more parameters than simpler models, which means it will take longer to train, especially on a CPU. Using a GPU or MPS can help speed up the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better performance**: With its deeper architecture and residual connections, ResNet-18 is likely to achieve higher accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to simpler models, especially if trained for enough epochs and with proper data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better convergence**: The residual connections in ResNet-18 help to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the model to converge more effectively during training, even with a deeper architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data augmentation**: To improve the generalization of the model, we can apply data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and color jittering to the training images. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data."
