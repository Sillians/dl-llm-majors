    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll set up a clean, modern Python environment and master the fundamental data object in all of deep learning: the tensor. Understanding tensors is crucial—they are the foundation upon which all neural network operations are built.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Platform Disclaimer**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This tutorial is designed for macOS, Linux, and Windows. The tooling (uv) is optimized for macOS and Linux. For GPU acceleration, PyTorch supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CUDA` (NVIDIA GPUs on Linux/Windows)\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll use `uv` to create a clean Python environment. This ensures that our dependencies are isolated and won't conflict with other projects.\n",

Visit the [PyTorch Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) page to find the right command for your setup. For example, for CUDA support on Linux, you might use:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",

    "print(\"MPS available:\", torch.backends.mps.is_available())\n",
